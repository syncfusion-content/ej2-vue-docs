## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Message component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Message component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=alert` | Used to convey a significant and contextual message to the user. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the close icon. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Message component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Message component.

| **Press** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Tab / Shift + Tab</kbd> | To focus the close icon in the message. |
| <kbd>Enter / Space</kbd> | Closes the focused close icon's message. |
