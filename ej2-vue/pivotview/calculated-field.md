# Calculated field in Vue Pivot Table component

The calculated field feature enables users to create custom value fields using mathematical formulas and existing fields from their data source. Users can perform complex calculations with basic arithmetic operators and seamlessly integrate these custom fields into their pivot table for enhanced data visualization and reporting.

## Creating calculated fields

Users can create calculated fields in two convenient ways:
- **Interactive Method**: Using the built-in dialog accessible from the Field List UI.
- **Code-Based Method**: Configuring fields programmatically using the [`calculatedFieldSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/iCalculatedFieldSettings) property.

To enable the calculated field functionality, set the [`allowCalculatedField`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/index-default#allowcalculatedfield) property to **true**. Once enabled, a "CALCULATED FIELD" button appears in the Field List UI. Clicking this button opens the calculated field dialog, where users can create and manage custom fields using an intuitive interface.

### Defining calculated fields programmatically

You can define calculated fields programmatically using the [`calculatedFieldSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/iCalculatedFieldSettings) property. This approach is ideal for pre-configuring specific calculations. The following properties are essential for creating a calculated field:

- [`name`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/iCalculatedFieldSettings#name): Specifies a unique name for the calculated field.
- [`formula`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/iCalculatedFieldSettings#formula): Defines the mathematical expression using existing field names and arithmetic operators.
- [`formatSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/iCalculatedFieldSettings#formatstring): Configures the number format for displaying calculated results.

To use the calculated field feature, you must inject the `CalculatedField` module into the pivot table.

> **Note**: The calculated field feature applies only to value fields. By default, calculated fields created programmatically are added to the field list and calculated field dialog UI. To display a calculated field in the pivot table UI, it must be added to the [`values`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/dataSourceSettings#values) property, as shown in the code below.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-grid/default-cs9/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-grid/default-cs9/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/pivot-grid/default-cs9" %}

## Opening the calculated field dialog programmatically

You can display the calculated field dialog by calling the [`createCalculatedFieldDialog`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/index-default#createcalculatedfielddialog) method when an external button is clicked. This provides additional flexibility for accessing the calculated field functionality.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-grid/default-cs10/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/pivot-grid/default-cs10/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/pivot-grid/default-cs10" %}

## Editing through the field list and grouping bar

You can easily modify existing calculated fields using the built-in edit option available in both the field list and grouping bar. This feature allows you to update formulas, change field names, or adjust formatting without recreating the entire calculated field.

To edit an existing calculated field:

1. Locate the calculated field button in either the field list or the grouping bar.
2. Click the **Edit** icon next to the calculated field name.
3. The calculated field dialog opens, displaying the current settings.

## Applying formatting to calculated field values

Formatting calculated field values enhances the readability and insight of your data in the pivot table. You can apply different formats using the calculated field dialog in the UI or programmatically through code.

To format calculated field values in your code, use the [`formatSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/formatSettings) property. For more information about supported number formats, refer to the documentation [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/pivotview/number-formatting).

### Formatting through the user interface

To apply formatting to calculated field values via the user interface, use the built-in "Format" dropdown available in the calculated field dialog. This dropdown provides the following predefined format options:

* **Standard** - Displays numbers in their basic numeric form.
* **Currency** - Displays numbers as currency values.
* **Percent** - Displays numbers as percentage values.
* **Custom** - Allows you to specify a custom format pattern.
* **None** - Applies no formatting to the values.

> **Note:** By default, **None** is selected in the dropdown.
