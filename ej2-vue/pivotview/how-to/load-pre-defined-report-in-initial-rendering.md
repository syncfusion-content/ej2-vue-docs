# Load desired report from the report list as default in vue Pivotview component

By default, the pivot table is displayed with the report bound at the code-behind. To load a desired report from the previously saved report collection during initial rendering, set the desired report name in the [`dataBound`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/pivotview/#databound) event, along with the additional report-based customization code shown below.
