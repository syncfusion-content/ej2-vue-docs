# Two way binding in Vue Auto complete component

Two-way binding can be achieved by using the `v-model` directive in Vue. In the following sample, when you change the value in one AutoComplete component, v-model will automatically update the value in the other AutoComplete.

The following example demonstrates how to set the `two-way-binding` in the AutoComplete.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/auto-complete/two-way-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/auto-complete/two-way-cs1" %}
