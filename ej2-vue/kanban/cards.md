# Cards in Vue Kanban component

The cards are main elements in Kanban board, which represent the task information with header and content. The header and content of a card is fetched from the corresponding mapping fields. The card layout can be customized with template also.

## Drag-and-drop

Transit or change the card position using the drag-and-drop functionality. By default, the `allowDragAndDrop` property is enabled on the Kanban board, which is used to change the card position by column-to-column or within the column.

Added dotted border on Kanban cells except the dragged clone cells when dragging, which indicates the possible ways for dropping the cards into the cells.

## Header

The card header is achieved by mapping the `headerField` property, which is placed inside the `cardSettings` property. By default, the `showHeader` property enabled by Kanban board that is used to show the header at the top of the card.

> The `headerField` property of `cardSettings` is mandatory to render the cards in the Kanban board. It acts as a unique field that is used to avoid the duplication of card data. You can not change the `headerField` of mapped data value using the `updateCard` public method or server-side update of data.

In the following demo, the `showHeader` property is disabled on Kanban board.

{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/kanban/card-header-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/kanban/card-header-cs1" %}

## Content

The card's content is fetched from data source using the `contentField` property, which is placed inside the `cardSettings` property. If the `contentField` property is not used, card is rendered with empty content.
