# Accessibility in Vue Kanban component

The Kanban component has been designed, keeping in mind the WAI-ARIA specifications, and applies the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties. This component is characterized by complete ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The accessibility compliance for the Kanban component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Kanban component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Kanban component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-label` |  It helps to provides information about elements in a kanban component for assistive technology. |
| `aria-expanded` | Attributes indicate the state of a collapsible element. |
| `aria-selected` | This attribute is assigned to the Kanban component for the selection of elements, and its default value is `false`. The value changes to true when the user selects a Kanban card. |
| `aria-grabbed` | Indicates whether the attribute is set to true. It has been selected for dragging. If this attribute is set to false, the element can be grabbed for a drag-and-drop operation but will not be currently grabbed. |
| `aria-describedby` | This attribute contains the ID of the Kanban header column to indicate that the attribute establishes an association between the Kanban header column and the Kanban column body. |
| `aria-roledescription` | This attribute is assigned to the Kanban component and is used to provide alternative descriptions for card elements. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Kanban component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.
