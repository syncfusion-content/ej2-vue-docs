{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/edit/default-cs47/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/edit/default-cs47/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
