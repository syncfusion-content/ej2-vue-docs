# Resize the grid in various dimension in Vue Grid component

The Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component offers a friendly way to resize the grid, allowing you to adjust its width and height for improved data visualization.

To resize the grid externally, you can use an external button to modify the width of the parent element that contains the grid. This will effectively resize the grid along with its parent container.

The following example demonstrates how to resize the grid on external button click based on input. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/how-to/grid-resize/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/how-to/grid-resize/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/how-to/grid-resize" %}
