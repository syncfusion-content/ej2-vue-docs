# Hierarchy grid in Vue Grid component

The Hierarchy Grid in an Vue Grid component is typically used when you need to display hierarchical data in a tabular format with expandable and collapsible rows. It allows you to represent parent and child relationships within the grid, making it easier for you to navigate and understand the data.

This feature can be enabled by utilizing the [childGrid](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#childgrid) and [childGrid.queryString](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#querystring) properties of the grid component.

To enable the Hierarchy Grid feature:

1. Inject the **DetailRow** module in the **provide** section. This module is Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> for handling the hierarchy grid functionality.

2. Define the `childGrid` property within the Grid component configuration. This property describes the options of the child grid.

3. Specify the `childGrid.queryString` property to establish the relation between the parent and child grids and visualizes the data in a hierarchical structure. This property determines how the child records are fetched based on the parent record.

The following example demonstrates how to enable the hierarchy feature in the grid

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs2" %}

> * Grid supports n level of child grids.
> * Hierarchical binding is not supported when [DetailTemplate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#detailtemplate) is enabled.

## Bind hierarchy grid with different field

By default, the parent and child grids have the same field name to map and render a hierarchical grid. However, the component supports establishing a parent-child relationship between grids with different field names. This feature is beneficial when you want to create a parent-child relationship between grids but need to use distinct field names for mapping the data. As a result, you can easily establish the desired relationship between the parent and child grids, even with different field names for data mapping.

By default, the parent and child grid relation is maintained using the [queryString](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#querystring) property, which requires the same field name for both grids. However, to achieve the parent and child relation with different fields, you need to modify the mapping value in the [load](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#load) event of child grid. 

In the following example, the `load` event is utilized to customize the mapping value for the child grid. By accessing the `parentDetails` property and its **parentKeyFieldValue**, you can set the desired mapping value. The `parentRowData` property contains the data of the parent row, and by using the **EmployeeID** field name, you can extract the corresponding value from the parent row data.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs6/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs6" %}

> Make sure to adjust the field name according to your specific scenario.

## Expand child grid initially

Expanding the child grid initially in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component is helpful when you want to display the child rows of the hierarchical grid expanded by default upon grid load. This can be beneficial in scenarios where you want to provide immediate visibility into the hierarchical data without requiring you to manually expand each child row.

To achieve this, you can use the [expand](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid/detailRow#expand) method with the desired target index (number) in the [dataBound](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#databound) event of the grid. 

In the provided example, expand the third record of the grid by utilizing the `expand` method within the `dataBound` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs4/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs4/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs4" %}

> Index values begin with **"0"**, allowing you to provide the desired target index to expand a specific child grid initially.

## Dynamically load child grid data

Dynamically load child grid data in Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid helps improve performance, optimize data transmission, and enhance the your experience by providing on-demand access to relevant information. Additionally, it offers flexibility in data presentation, which helps improve the overall efficiency of your application.

To dynamically load the `dataSource` of a child grid in the Grid, you can utilize the [load](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#load) event of parent grid. This event allows you to customize the loading behavior of the child grid based on the data of parent grid.

The following example demonstrates how to dynamically load child grid data using the `load` event.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs5/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs5/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs5" %}

## Dynamically bind data to child grid based on parent row Data

Dynamically binding data to a child grid based on the parent row data in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component is useful when you want to display child grid data that is specific to each parent row. This feature allows for a dynamic and contextual representation of data within the child grid.

To dynamically bind data to the child grid based on the parent row data instead of using the [queryString](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#querystring) property, you can utilize the [detailDataBound](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#detaildatabound) event of the grid. This event is triggered when expanding the child grid.

In the `detailDataBound` event handler, you can filter the child grid's dataSource based on the **EmployeeID** column value of the parent row data. This can be achieved by using the `DataManager` plugin and applying a filter to the child grid's dataSource. The filtered data can be assigned as the new dataSource for the child grid. This can be demonstrated by the following sample.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs8/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs8/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs8" %}

## Adding record in child grid

Adding a record in a child grid within the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component is useful when you want to provide the ability to add new records to the child grid. This feature allows you to input and save additional data specific to each parent row.

To maintain the parent-child relationship in the Grid when adding a record to the child grid, you need to set the value for the `queryString` in the added data. This can be done using the [actionBegin](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#actionbegin) event.

In the following example, the parent and child grids are related by the **EmployeeID** field. To add a new record in the child grid, the **EmployeeID** field needs to be set with the value of the parent record's `queryString` in the `actionBegin` event. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs7/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs7/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs7" %}

## Template column in child grid

A template column in a child grid within the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component is valuable when you want to customize the appearance and functionality of specific columns in the child grid. It is useful for incorporating interactive elements, custom formatting, or complex data representation within specific columns of the child grid.

To achieve this, you can utilize the [template](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid/column#template) property of a column to display a custom element instead of a field value in the Grid.

The following example demonstrates, how to show a custom image in the **Employee Image** column of the child grid by utilizing the `template` property of the column.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs11/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs11/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs11" %}

## How to get parent detail in child grid

Getting parent details in a child grid in an Vue Grid component is useful when you want to display and utilize information from the parent row within the child grid. This can be beneficial in scenarios where you need to provide additional context or perform calculations based on the parent row's data

To achieve this, you can utilize the [created](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#created) event. This event is triggered when the child grid is created and can be used to handle the child grid.

The following example demonstrates how to obtain parent details in a child grid using the `created` event. Within the `created` event, you can access the parent row data using `this.parentDetails.parentRowData` and display the desired details in the message.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs12/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs12/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs12" %}

## Render aggregates in child grid

The Aggregates feature in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component allows you to display aggregate values in the footer, group footer, and group caption of the child grid. With this feature, you can easily perform calculations on specific columns and show summary information. 

Rendering aggregates in a child grid involves displaying summary data at the footer or group caption of the grid. This can be particularly useful in hierarchical grids where each child grid represents detailed data that needs to be summarized.

The following example demonstrates how to render aggregates in a child grid to display the sum and maximum values of the **Freight** column.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-hierarchy/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-hierarchy/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-hierarchy" %}

## Expand all by external button

The Hierarchy Grid in the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid component allows you to expand all child grid rows using an external button. This feature provides you with a convenient overview of all the hierarchical data within the grid, eliminating the need to manually expand each row individually.

By default, Grid renders all child grid rows in collapsed state. To expand all child grid rows in the Grid using an external button, you can utilize the [expandAll](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid/detailRow#expandall) method provided by the DetailRow module. Similarly, to collapse all grid rows, you can use the [collapseAll](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid/detailRow#collapseall) method. 

The following example demonstrates how to expand and collapse the hierarchy grid using an external button click function.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs3" %}

> The `expandAll` and `collapseAll` methods are not recommended for large datasets due to the considerable time it takes to update the changes in the UI.

## Hide the expand/collapse icon in parent row when no record in child grid

The Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue Grid allows you to hide the expand/collapse icon in the parent row when there are no records in the child grid. However, in certain scenarios, you may want to hide the expand/collapse icon for parent rows that do not have any child records, providing a cleaner and more intuitive interface by eliminating unnecessary icons in empty parent rows.

To achieve this, you can utilize the [rowDataBound](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/grid#rowdatabound) event to hide the icon when there are no records in the child grid.

To hide the expand/collapse icon in parent row when no records in child grid, follow the given steps:

1. **Create a CSS Class with Custom Style**: Define a CSS class that overrides the default appearance of the Grid. This class will be used to customize the background color of the parent row when it is selected and when hovering over rows.

```css
    .e-row[aria-selected="true"] .e-customizedexpandcell {
        background-color: #e0e0e0;
    }

    .e-grid.e-gridhover tr[role='row']:hover {
        background-color: #eee;
    }
```

2. **Implement the rowDataBound Event Handler:** This event is triggered for each row in the grid when data is bound, allowing you to customize the row's appearance and behavior. In the provided code, the handler checks if the current row has any child records associated with it. If not, it hides the content of the first element, which contains the expand/collapse icon, and applies a custom CSS class (e-customizedexpandcell) to modify its appearance.

```typescript
    rowDataBound: function (args) {
      let parentData = (args.data)['EmployeeID'];
      let childrecord = new DataManager(data).executeLocal(new Query().where('EmployeeID', 'equal', parentData, true));
      if (childrecord.length === 0) {
        // Here hide which parent row has no child records
        let rowElement = args.row;
        let cellElement = rowElement.querySelector('td');
        cellElement.innerHTML = ' ';
        cellElement.className = 'e-customizedexpandcell';
      }
    }
```

The following example demonstrates how to hide the expand/collapse icon in the row with **EmployeeID** as **1**, which does not have record in child Grid.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs13/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs13/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-cs13" %}

## Change hierarchy grid icon in Grid

You can customize the default expand/collapse icons in the Hierarchy Grid of Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Grid component using custom CSS, allowing you to modify their visual representation. To achieve this, add the following CSS to your index.html file:

```
    .e-grid .e-icon-grightarrow::before,
    .e-grid-menu .e-icon-grightarrow::before {
    content: '\e7f9';
    }
    .e-grid .e-icon-gdownarrow::before,
    .e-grid-menu .e-icon-gdownarrow::before {
    content: '\e7d8';
    }

```

In the demo below, the expand/collapse icons have been changed to arrow-down and arrow-right icons.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-icon/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-icon/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/default-icon" %}

## Detail row events

The Grid control's `detailExpand` and `detailCollapse` events fire before a detail row actually expands or collapses, allowing you a chance to control whether the action should continue. The `detailExpand` event is raised just before a row expands, and `detailCollapse` fires just before a row collapses, with both events providing respective details through their event arguments.

In the example below, expansion is prevented for the "Nancy" row, and collapse is prevented for the "Andrew" row.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/grid/hierarchy-grid/detail-row-events/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
