# Accessibility in Vue Treemap component

TreeMap has built-in accessibility features like screen reading and WAI-ARIA attributes.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The TreeMap component follows the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the TreeMap component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=region` | It specifies the TreeMap areas that do not support interactive functions like selection and highlight. |
| `role=button` | It specifies the TreeMap areas where interactive functions such as selection and highlight are available. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the data labels, legend title, and legend item labels. |

## Screen reading in TreeMap

Accessibility in the TreeMap component ensures that all users, regardless of ability or disability, can use screen reading. The following TreeMap elements will be read aloud using screen reading software, such as Narrator for Windows.

| Elements | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data labels | Reads the labels displayed on leaf items of the TreeMap. |
| Legend title | Reads the titleÂ of the legend in the TreeMap. |
| Legend item label | Reads the label of the legend item in the TreeMap. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The TreeMap component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the TreeMap component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/treemap.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the TreeMap component with accessibility tools.
