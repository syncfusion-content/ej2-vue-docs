# Globalization in Vue Splitter component

## RTL

Specifies the direction of the Splitter component using the enableRtl property. For writing systems that require it like Arabic, Hebrew, etc., the direction can be switched to right-to-left.

The following code shows how to enable RTL behavior.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/splitter/rtl-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/splitter/rtl-cs1" %}
