# Use dynamic templates in listview based on device in Vue Listview component

The Syncfusion Essential JS2 components are desktop and mobile-friendly. So, you can use Syncfusion components in both modes. The component templates are not always fixed. Applications may need to load various templates depending upon the device.

## Integration

In the ListView component, template support is being used. In some cases, the component wrapper is always responsive across all devices, but the template contents are dynamically changed with unspecified (sample side) dimensions. CSS customization is also needed in sample-side to align template content responsively in both mobile and desktop modes. Here, two templates have been loaded for mobile and desktop modes. To check the device mode, a browser module has been imported from the [ej2-base](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/overview/) package.
