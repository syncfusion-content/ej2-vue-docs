# Index in Vue ListView component

The ListView component represents the data in interactive hierarchical structure interface across different layouts or views, that also has features such as data-binding, template, grouping and Virtualization.

## Key Features

* **[Data binding](./data-binding)**: Supports data binding to display the list of items from the local or server-side data source.

* **[Grouping](./grouping)**: Provides support to group the logically related items under a category.

* **[Nested list](./nested-list)**:  Displays a set of nested list items in different layout.

* **[Customizing templates](./customizing-templates)**: Allows you to customize the list item, header, and category group header.

* **[Virtualization](./virtualization)**: Allows you to load only viewable list items in a view port which
will increase ListView performance on loading large number of data.

* **[Accessibility](./accessibility)**: Provides built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the ListView component features through the keyboard, on-screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
