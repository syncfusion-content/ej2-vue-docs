# Accessibility in Vue 3D Chart component

Accessibility is achieved in the 3D chart component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigation. The 3D chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

* img (role)
* button (role)
* region (role)
* aria-label (attribute)
* aria-hidden (attribute)
* aria-pressed (attribute)

## Keyboard navigation

All the 3D chart actions can be controlled via keyboard keys. The applicable key combinations and their relative functionalities are listed below.
