# Grid tick in Vue Range navigator component

## Grid line customization

The gridlines indicate axis divisions by drawing the chart plot. Gridlines include helpful cues to the user, particularly for large or complicated charts. The `width`, `color`, and `dashArray` of the major gridlines can be customized by using the [`majorGridLines`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/range-navigator/#majorgridlines) setting.
