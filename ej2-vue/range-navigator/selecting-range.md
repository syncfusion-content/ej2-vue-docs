# Selecting range in Vue Range navigator component

The Range Selector's left and right thumbs are used to indicate the selected range in the large collection of data. A range can be selected in the following ways:

* By dragging the thumbs.
* By tapping on the labels.
* By setting the start and the end through the [`value`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/range-navigator/#value) property.
