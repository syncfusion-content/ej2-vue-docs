# Setting header of panels in Vue Dashboard layout component

The dashboard layout component is mostly used to represent the data used for monitoring or managing a process. These data or any HTML template can be placed as the content of a panel using the `content` property. Also, word or phrase that summarize the panelâ€™s content can be added as the header on the top of each panel using the `header` property of the panel.

The following sample demonstrates how to add content for each panel using the header and content properties of the panels.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1" %}

## Placing components as content of panels

In a dashboard, components like the chart, grids, maps, gauge, and more etc. can be used to present a complex data. Such components can be placed as the panel content by assigning the corresponding component element as the `content` of the panel.
