# Setting header of panels in Vue Dashboard Layout component

The Dashboard Layout component is mostly used to represent the data used for monitoring or managing a process. These data or any HTML template can be placed as the content of a panel using the [`content`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/dashboard-layout/panelModel/#content) property. Also, word or phrase that summarize the panelâ€™s content can be added as the header on the top of each panel using the [`header`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/dashboard-layout/panelModel/#header) property of the panel.

The following sample demonstrates how to add content for each panel using the header and content properties of the panels.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1" %}

## Setting Content of panels using v-slot directive

The Dashboard Layout component in Syncfusion's Vue.js suite facilitates dynamic content insertion into panels through the **v-slot directive**. This feature allows for the definition of custom content for each panel in a flexible and maintainable manner. By leveraging v-slot, it becomes straightforward to incorporate complex HTML structures, custom components, or dynamic content into each panel of the Dashboard Layout. 

In the example below, the v-slot directive is employed with a named slot 'panel0Content' to specify the content for 'panel0'. The content is encapsulated within a <template> tag, which corresponds to the :content attribute of the <e-panel> component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/vslot-content/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/vslot-content/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/dashboard-layout/vslot-content" %}

## Placing components as content of panels

In a dashboard, components like the chart, grids, maps, gauge, and more etc. can be used to present a complex data. Such components can be placed as the panel content by assigning the corresponding component element as the [`content`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/dashboard-layout/panelModel/#content) of the panel.

The following sample demonstrates how to add EJ2 Chart components as the `content` for each panel in the Dashboard Layout component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/content-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/content-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/dashboard-layout/content-cs1" %}
