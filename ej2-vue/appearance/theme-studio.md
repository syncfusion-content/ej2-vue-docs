# Theme studio in Vue Appearance component

Theme Studio for Essential JS 2 can be used to customize a new theme from an existing theme. It doesn't support with Data visualization components like Chart, Diagram, Gauge, Range Navigator, Maps.

## Customizing theme color from theme studio

The Syncfusion Vue (Essential JS 2) themes are developed under the SCSS environment. Each theme has a unique common variable list. When you change the common variable color code value, it will reflect in all Syncfusion Vue UI components. All Syncfusion Vue component styles are derived from these [theme-based common variables](theme#common-variables). This common variable list is handled inside the theme studio application for customizing theme-based colors.

**Step 1:** Navigate to the theme studio application at [https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/themestudio/).

**Step 2:** The theme studio application page can be divided into two sections: the components preview section on the left, and the theme customization section on the right.

### Filtering a specific list of components

Using the theme studio, you can apply custom themes to a list of specific components. This option is useful when you have integrated a selective list of Syncfusion Vue components in your application. The theme studio will filter the selected components and customize the final output for those component's styles alone, reducing the final output file size.

**Step 1:** Click the Filter icon in the top right corner and select the components whose theme you want to customize.

**Step 2:** Click the Apply button in the Filter dialog. Now, only the selected components will be rendered in the components preview section.

**Step 3:** The download styles will come as a zip file that contains SCSS and CSS files for the selected Syncfusion Vue components. The current settings are stored in the `settings.json` file.

### Using a customized theme in a web application

You can directly use the customized CSS file in the web application.

**Step 1:** Copy/paste the customized CSS file from the download folder into your application at any folder. Example: `styles/{file-name}.css`.

**Step 2:** Refer the customized CSS file reference in the `index.html` or `shared/_layout.cshtml` main page head section.

```
    <head>
        <link href="styles/{file-name}.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    </head>
```

## Import previously changed settings into the theme studio

When you want to change your application theme and UI design in the future, you wonâ€™t need to customize the Syncfusion Vue components from scratch in the theme studio. Just import the old `settings.json` file to review and update your stored settings in the theme studio application.

**Step 1:** Click the Import icon in the top right corner.
