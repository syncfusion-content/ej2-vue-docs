# Material 3 Theme with CSS Variables

[Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) is the latest version of Google's open-source design system, Material Design. It's the successor to [Material 2](https://m2.material.io/), which is a popular design system used in many apps. It has been specifically designed to align seamlessly with the new visual style and system UI introduced in Android 12 and above.

[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), also known as custom properties, are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values that can be reused throughout a CSS file. They are identified by their name, which must begin with two hyphens (--) followed by an identifier. These variables can be assigned any valid CSS value, such as colors, lengths, or fonts. To retrieve the value of a CSS variable, the var() function is used.

## Material 3 - Syncfusion Vue Components

Syncfusion has introduced the Material 3 theme across all EJ2 Components, featuring both `light` and `dark` variants. This theme utilizes `CSS variables` to allow easy customization of Component colors in CSS format. With this implementation, users can seamlessly switch between light and dark color schemes, providing a flexible solution to meet their preferences and application needs.

> Kindly note that in the Material 3 theme, Syncfusion utilizes CSS variables with rgb() values for color variables. The use of hex values in this context may lead to improper functionality. For example, in previous versions of the Material theme or other themes, the primary color variable was defined as follows: $primary: #6200ee;. However, in the Material 3 theme, the primary color variable is defined as follows: --color-sf-primary: 98, 0, 238;.
