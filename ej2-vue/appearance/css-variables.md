# About CSS variables in themes

[CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), also known as custom properties, are entities defined by CSS authors that contain specific values that can be reused throughout a CSS file. They are identified by their name, which must begin with two hyphens (--) followed by an identifier. These variables can be assigned any valid CSS value, such as colors, lengths, or fonts. To retrieve the value of a CSS variable, the var() function is used.

Syncfusion currently offers two modern and highly customizable themes using CSS variables. These themes are designed to provide a consistent and visually appealing look and feel across all Syncfusion components. The themes available are:

* Material 3 Theme
* Fluent 2 Theme
* Bootstrap 5.3 Theme

## CSS themes - Syncfusion Vue components

[Material 3](https://m3.material.io/), [Fluent 2](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/get-started/whatisnew) and [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) themes have been introduced across all EJ2 Controls, featuring both `light` and `dark` variants. This themes utilizes `CSS variables` to allow easy customization of control colors in CSS format. With this implementation, users can seamlessly switch between light and dark color schemes, providing a flexible solution to meet their preferences and application needs.

> Kindly note that in the Material 3 theme, CSS variables with rgb() values are used for color variables. The use of hex values in this context may lead to improper functionality. For example, in previous versions of the Material theme or other themes, the primary color variable was defined as follows: $primary: #6200ee;. However, in the Material 3 theme, the primary color variable is defined as follows: --color-sf-primary: 98, 0, 238;.

### Utilization of CSS variables in modern themes

Modern themes like Material 3, Fluent 2 and Bootstrap 5.3 incorporate support with CSS variables, where `Material 3` utilizes `rgb()` values for customizing colors while `Fluent 2` uses `hex` values for color customization. `Bootstrap 5.3` allows color customization with both  `rgb()` and `hex` values. For more information you can refer this [documentation](./theme#syncfusion-material-3-theme) for color variables of these themes.  The examples below shows CSS variables with their values used for the respective themes.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="material3.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/css-value-cs1/material3.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="fluent2.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/css-value-cs1/fluent2.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="bootstrap5.3.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/css-value-cs1/bootstrap5.3.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

### Switching Light and Dark mode with CSS variables

Switching between modes has become easier with the updated modern themes, which offer Light and Dark variants. In both the `Material 3` and `Fluent 2` light themes, there are distinct class variables for light and dark modes in a `single file`, providing flexibility for seamless switching between the two modes within your application.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/material3-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/common/material3-cs1" %}

### Mode switching in Fluent 2 theme

Similar to `Material 3`, we offer both Light and Dark variants with `Fluent 2`. In the Fluent 2 theme, there are distinct class variables for light and dark modes, as shown in the preview below.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/fluent2-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/common/fluent2-cs1" %}

### Mode switching in Bootstrap 5.3 theme

Similar to `Fluent 2`, we offer both Light and Dark variants with `Bootstrap 5.3`. In the Bootstrap 5.3 theme, there are distinct class variables for light and dark modes, as shown in the preview below.

{% tabs %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/common/bootstrap5.3-cs1" %}
