# Size modes in Vue Appearance component

An application that is designed to be accessed through a web browser on various devices, including desktop computers and mobile devices, may have a distinct layout or user interface on a mobile device compared to a desktop computer to better suit the smaller screen size.

Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Vue components support both touch (bigger) and normal size modes. Touch mode creates a responsive design for mobile devices by adding the `e-bigger` class, which enhances interactions, visibility, and the overall experience.

## Size mode for application

The user can enable touch mode (bigger) for the entire application by adding the `e-bigger` class to the `body` element in the `index.html` file as follows:

  ```
  <body className="e-bigger">
    ...
  </body>
  ```

## Size mode for a component

The user can enable touch mode (bigger) for a component by adding the `e-bigger` class to the `div` element that contains the component. Another way of enabling touch mode is by adding the `e-bigger` class using the available `cssClass` property of the component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs1" %}

## Change size mode for application at runtime

The user can change the size mode of the application between touch and normal (mouse) mode at runtime by adding and removing the `e-bigger` class. The following steps explain how to change the size mode of an application at runtime:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs2" %}

## Change size mode for a component at runtime

The user can change the size mode of a component between touch and normal (mouse) mode at runtime by setting the `e-bigger` CSS class.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/common/size-modes-cs3" %}
