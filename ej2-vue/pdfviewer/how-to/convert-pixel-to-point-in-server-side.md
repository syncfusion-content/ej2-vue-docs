# Convert pixel to point in server side in Vue Pdfviewer component

Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> PDF viewer will get the bounds of the annotations as the pixel in the Client-side. But while using it in the back end, we need to convert the pixel into point by using the below calculation. And the 0.75 is constant for all the calculations in the back end.

```ts

X = x * 72 / 96
Y = y * 72 / 96
Width = width * 72 / 96
Height = height * 72 / 96

```
