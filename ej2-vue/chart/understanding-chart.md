# Understanding of Vue Chart

To understand how Syncfusion Vue Chart works, it is important to learn about the various parts of a chart.
The image below illustrates the main elements of the chart.

## Title

The title is the text that explains what the chart represents. It is usually displayed at the top of the chart.
For more details, see [Title and Subtitle](./title-subtitle.md).

## Series

Each series represents a set of data values plotted on the chart. For more details, see [Series](./chart-types/line.md).

## Tooltip

Tooltips provide quick insights by showing value details when you hover over a data point or series on the chart.
For more details, see [Tooltip](./tool-tip.md).

## Legend

A legend identifies each data series in the chart and provides options to toggle them on or off.
For more details, see [Legend](./legend.md).

## Axes

Charts typically rely on axes to organize data. Standard Cartesian charts have two: an x-axis (horizontal) and a y-axis (vertical). Three-dimensional charts add a z-axis for depth, and polar charts feature one axis that wraps around the chart’s perimeter.
