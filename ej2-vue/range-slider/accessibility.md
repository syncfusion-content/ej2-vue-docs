## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Range Slider component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Range Slider component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=slider` | Used to convey a significant and contextual message to the user. |
| `aria-valuemin` | Indicates the Minimum value of the Slider. |
| `aria-valuemax` | Indicates the Maximum value of the Slider. |
| `aria-valuenow` | Indicates the current value of the Slider. |
| `aria-valuetext` | Returns the current text of the Slider. |
| `aria-orientation` | Indicates whether the Slider is oriented horizontally or vertically. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the Slider, serving as label text for the Slider's left and right buttons (for increment and decrement). |

## Keyboard interaction

The Range Slider component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Range Slider component.

| **Press** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd>/<kbd>Up Arrow</kbd> | Increase the Slider value. |
| <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd>/<kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> | Decrease the Slider value. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> | Moves to the start value (for Range Slider when the second thumb is focused and the Home key is pressed, it moves to the first thumb value). |
| <kbd>End | Moves to the end value (for Range Slider when the first thumb is focused and the End key is pressed, it moves to the second thumb value). |
| <kbd>Page Up</kbd> | 	Increases the Slider by `largeStep` value. |
| <kbd>Page Down</kbd> | Decreases the Slider by `largeStep` value. |
