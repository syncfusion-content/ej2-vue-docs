# Context menu in Vue Schedule component

You can display context menu on work cells and appointments of Scheduler by making use of the [`ContextMenu`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/context-menu/getting-started) control manually from the application end. In the following code example, context menu control is being added from sample end and set its target as `Scheduler`.

On Scheduler cells, you can display the menu items such as `New Event`, `New Recurring Event` and `Today` option. For appointments, you can display its related options such as `Edit Event` and `Delete Event`. The default event window can be opened for appointment creation and editing using the [`openEditor`](../api/schedule/#openeditor) method of Scheduler.

The deletion of appointments can be done by using the [`deleteEvent`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule#deleteevent) public method. Also, the [`selectedDate`](../api/schedule/#selecteddate) property can be used to navigate between different dates.

> You can also display custom menu options on Scheduler cells and appointments. Context menu will open on tap-hold in responsive mode.
