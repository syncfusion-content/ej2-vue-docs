# Half yearly view in Vue Schedule component

The year view of our scheduler displays all the 365 days and their related appointments of a particular year. You can customize the year view by using the following properties.

* [`firstMonthOfYear`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule/#firstmonthofyear)
* [`monthsCount`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule/#monthscount)
* [`monthHeaderTemplate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/schedule/#monthheadertemplate)

In the following code example, you can see how to render only the last six months of a year in the scheduler. To start with the month of  June, `firstMonthYear` is set to 6 and `monthsCount` is set to 6 to render only 6 months.
