# Accessibility in Vue Schedule component

The Scheduler has been designed based on the WAI-ARIA specifications, thus applying the appropriate ARIA roles, states and properties for the Scheduler elements. It is also available with a built-in keyboard navigation support, making it easier for the people who use assistive technologies or who completely rely on the Keyboard support. As per the accessibility standard, the navigated dates, views and other interactive actions performed on the Scheduler will be read out to the target users who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.

The Scheduler makes use of the most required ARIA attributes such as `aria-label` and `role` to support the accessibility in it. To be more accurate, it must be used with an ARIA compliant browser along with the screen reader running from backend.

The accessibility compliance for the Schedule component is outlined below.

## ARIA attributes

The Scheduler parent element is assigned with a role of `main`, to denote it as the main content of a component as well as a unique element of the entire document.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Scheduler.

| Attributes | Description |
|-------|---------|
| role="main" |  Attribute added to the Scheduler element describes the actual role of the element and denote it as a main and unique content. |
| role="button" | Attribute is assigned to the appointments of Scheduler, to denote it as a clickable element. |
| aria-label | Attribute is set to the Scheduler parent element and its default value is Scheduler's current date. On every time, the date is navigated, this attribute is updated with appropriate current date values. It is also assigned to other scheduler UI elements such as previous and next date navigation buttons depicting its purpose, div element displaying date range in the header bar and appointment elements. |
| aria-labelledby | It indicates editor dialog title to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-describedby | It indicates editor dialog content description to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-disabled | Attribute is set to the appointment element to indicates the disabled state of the Scheduler.

## Keyboard interaction

All the Scheduler actions can be controlled via keyboard keys by using the `allowKeyboardInteraction` property which is set to `true` by default. The following are the standard keys that work on Scheduler.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Scheduler component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Scheduler component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/schedule.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Scheduler component with accessibility tools.
