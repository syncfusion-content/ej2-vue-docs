# Syncfusion Licensing Overview

We have introduced license key validation for Essential JS2 platforms from the 2022 Volume 1 release. This licensing key validation will enforce the developer to register the valid licensing key in an application while referring to any of the latest JavaScript packages, either from npm or CDN or build.

License key can be obtained from the [My Account >> License and downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/login) section of the Syncfusion website. To obtain a license key, you will need to have an active trial or license or community license.

Before using any JavaScript controls, you must register the obtained license key in the application code. Otherwise you will get license validation error message in application as shown in below

> This application was built using a trial version of Syncfusion Essential Studio. Please include a valid license to permanently remove this license validation message. You can also obtain a free 30 day evaluation license to temporarily remove this message during the evaluation period. Please refer to this [help topic](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/licensing/licensing-errors#license-key-not-registered) for more information.

## Difference between unlock key and license key

Please note that this license key is different from the installer unlock key that you might have used in the past and needs to be separately generated from Syncfusion website.

* **Unlock Key** - Syncfusion Unlock Key is used to unlock the Syncfusion installers alone.

* **License Key** - Syncfusion License Key is a string that needs to be registered in your script to avoid licensing warning.

> Refer to [this](https://support.syncfusion.com/kb/article/7863/difference-between-the-unlock-key-and-licensing-key?isInternalRefresh=False) KB article to know more about difference between the Syncfusion Unlock Key and the Syncfusion License Key.
