## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Dropdown Tree component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Dropdown Tree component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=listbox` | All list items are contained within the element. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates element is perceivable but disabled. |
| `aria-owns` | This attribute contains the ID of the popup list to indicate popup as a child element. |
| `aria-haspopup` | Indicates whether the Dropdown Tree input element has a popup list or not. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates the state of the popup list for Dropdown Tree and the parent node's expansion status for TreeView. |
| `aria-activedescendent` | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element. |
| `aria-labelledby` | This attribute points to the element(s) labeling the element it's applied to. |
| `aria-decribedby` | This attribute points to the element(s) describing the one it's set on. |
| `role=tree` | All tree nodes are contained within the element. |
| `role=treeitem`| Specifies the role of each tree node in a selectable TreeView and its containment within the tree. |
| `role=group` | Specifies the role of each parent node container in the TreeView. |
| `role=checkbox` | Indicates checkbox control along with treeitem element. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Dropdown Tree component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Dropdown Tree component.

| Interaction Keys | Description |
|------|---------|
| <kbd>Alt + Down</kbd> | Opens the popup. |
| <kbd>Alt + Up</kbd> | Closes the popup. |
| <kbd>Esc(Escape)</kbd> | Closes the popup when it is in an open state. |
| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> | Goes to the previous item in the popup. |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd> | Goes to the next item in the popup. |
| <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd> | Expands the current item in the popup. |
| <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd> | Collapses the current item in the popup. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> | Goes to the first item in the popup. |
| <kbd>End</kbd> | Goes to the last item in the popup. |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Selects the focused item in the popup. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Checks the current item in the popup. |
