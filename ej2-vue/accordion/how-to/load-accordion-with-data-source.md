# Load accordion with data source in Vue Accordion component

You can bind any data object to Accordion items, by mapping it to [`header`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#header) and [`content`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/accordion/accordionItem#content) property.

In the below demo, Data is fetched from an `OData` service using `DataManager`. The result data is formatted as a JSON object with `header` and `content` fields, which is set to items property of Accordion.
