# Set custom animation in Vue Accordion component

Accordion supports custom animations for both expand and collapse actions from the provided animation option of `Animation` library.

Default animation is given as `SlideDown` for expanding the panel and `SlideUp` for collapsing the panel. You can also disable the animation by setting animation effect as `none`.

The sample demonstrates some types of animation that suits for Accordion. You can check all the animation effects here.
