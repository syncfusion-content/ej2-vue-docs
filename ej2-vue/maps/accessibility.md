# Accessibility in Vue Maps component

Maps has built-in accessibility features like screen reading, keyboard navigation, and WAI-ARIA attributes.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

To meet accessibility standards, the Maps component follows to the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns. In the Maps component, the following ARIA attributes are used:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=region` | It specifies the Maps areas that do not support interactive functions like selection and highlight. |
| `role=button` | It specifies the Maps areas where interactive functions such as selection and highlight are available. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for Maps elements such as geometric map shapes, legend title, data labels, and so on. To learn more, see the next topic. |

## Screen reading in Maps

Accessibility in the Maps component ensures that all users, regardless of ability or disability, can use screen reading. The following Map elements will be read aloud using screen reading software, such as Narrator for Windows.
