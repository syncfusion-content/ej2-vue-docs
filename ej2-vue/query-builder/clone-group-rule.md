# Clone Group/Rule in Vue Query builder component

Query Builder allows you to clone rules as well as groups. The Clone options will create an exact replica of a rule or group next to the original. You can use [`showButtons`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/query-builder/#showbuttons) to enable/disable these buttons.

You can clone groups and rules by interacting through the user interface and methods.

* Use the [`cloneGroup`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/query-builder/#cloneGroup) method to clone group.
* Use [`cloneRule`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/query-builder/#cloneRule) method to clone rule.
