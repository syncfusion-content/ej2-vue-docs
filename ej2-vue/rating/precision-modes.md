# Precision modes in Vue Rating component

You can use the [`precision`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/rating/#precision) property of the rating component to provide ratings with varying levels of precision.

The precision types of Rating are as follows:

* Full: The rating is increased in whole number increments. For example, if the current rating is 2, the next possible ratings are 3, 4, and so on.
* Half: The rating is increased in increments of 0.5 (half). For example, if the current rating is 2.5, the next possible ratings are 3, 3.5, 4, and so on.
* Quarter: The rating is increased in increments of 0.25 (quarter). For example, if the current rating is 3.75, the next possible ratings are 4, 4.25, 4.5, and so on.
* Exact: The rating is increased in increments of 0.1. For example, if the current rating is 3.9, the next possible ratings are 4, 4.1, 4.2, and so on.
