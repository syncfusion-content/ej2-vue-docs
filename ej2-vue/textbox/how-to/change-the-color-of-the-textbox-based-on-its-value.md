# Change the color of the textbox based on its value in Vue Textbox component

You can change the color of the TextBox by validating its value using regular expression in the `keyup` event for predicting the numeric values as demonstrated in the following code sample.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/text-color-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/textbox/text-color-cs1" %}
