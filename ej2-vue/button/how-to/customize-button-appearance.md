# Customize button appearance in Vue Button component

You can customize the appearance of the Button by using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Define the CSS according to your requirement, and assign the class name to the [`cssClass`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/button/#cssclass) property. In the following code snippet the background color, text color, height, width, and sharp corner of the Button can be customized through the `e-custom` class for all states (hover, focus, and active).

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/button/default-cs6/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/button/default-cs6" %}
