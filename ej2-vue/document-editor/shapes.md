## Text wrapping style

Text wrapping refers to how shapes fit with surrounding text in a document. Please [refer to this page](../document-editor/text-wrapping-style) for more information about text wrapping styles available in Word documents.

## Positioning the shape

Document Editor preserves the position properties of the shape and displays the shape based on position properties. It does not support modifying the position properties. Whereas the shape will be automatically moved along with text edited if it is positioned relative to the line or paragraph.
