## WAI-ARIA attributes

The List box component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the List box component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Indicates the List box component wrapper element as `List box`, the `UL` element as `presentation`, and its list item as `option`. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the List box component. |
| `aria-multiselectable` | Applied to the element with the List box role, tells assistive technologies that the list supports multiple selection. The default value is true. |
| `aria-selected` | Applied to elements with role option that are visually styled as selected to inform assistive technologies that the options are selected. |

## Keyboard interaction

The List box component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the List box component.

| **Press** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- |
| <kbd>Up arrow</kbd> | Moves focus to the previous option. |
| <kbd>Down arrow</kbd> | Moves focus to the next option. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> | Moves focus to first option. |
| <kbd>End</kbd> | Moves focus to last option. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Changes the selection state of the focused option. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + A</kbd> | Selects all options in the list. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Home</kbd> | Selects the focused option and all options up to the first option. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + End</kbd> | Selects the focused option and all options down to the last option. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + (Up or Down)</kbd> | Press Ctrl key with up / down arrow or mouse to select multiple items. |
