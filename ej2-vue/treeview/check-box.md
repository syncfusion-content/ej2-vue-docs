# Check box in Vue Treeview component

The TreeView component allows you to check more than one node in TreeView without affecting the UI's appearance by enabling the [showCheckBox](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#showcheckbox) property. When this property is enabled, checkboxappears before each TreeView node text.

* If one of the child nodes is not in a checked state, then the parent node will be in an intermediate state.

* If all the child nodes are in checked state, then the parent node's state will also be checked.

* If a parent node is checked, then all the child nodes' state will also be checked.

By default, the checkbox state of parent and child nodes are dependent on each other. If you need independent checked state, you can achieve it using the [`autoCheck`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#autocheck) property.

Using the [`checkedNodes`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#checkednodes) property, you can set the nodes that need to be checked or get the ID of nodes that are currently checked in the TreeView component.

If you need to prevent the node check action for a particular node, the [`nodeChecking`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#nodechecking) event can be used which is triggered before the TreeView node is checked/unchecked. The [`nodeChecked`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#nodechecked) event will be triggered when the TreeView node is checked/unchecked successfully.

In the following example, the `showCheckBox` property is enabled.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/checkbox/checkbox-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treeview/checkbox/checkbox-cs1" %}

## Checked nodes

You can get or set the checked nodes in TreeView at initial rendering and dynamically by using the [checkedNodes](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#checkednodes)
property. It returns the checked nodes' ID as an array.

In the following example, the **New South Wales** and **Western Australia** nodes are checked at initial rendering. If any more nodes are checked, the checked nodes' IDs will be displayed in alert.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/treeview/checkbox/checked-nodes-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treeview/checkbox/checked-nodes-cs1" %}
