# Index in Vue TreeView component

The **TreeView** component is used to represent hierarchical data in a tree like structure with advanced functions to edit, drag and drop, select with CheckBox and more. TreeView can be populated from a data source such as an array of JavaScript objects or
from DataManager.

## Key features

* **[Data Binding](../treeview/data-binding)**: Binds the TreeView component with an array of JavaScript objects or `DataManager`.

* **[CheckBox](../treeview/check-box)**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView without affecting the UI appearance.

* **[Drag and Drop](../treeview/drag-and-drop)**: Allows you to drag and drop any node in TreeView.

* **[Multi Selection](../treeview/multiple-selection)**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView.

* **[Node Editing](../treeview/node-editing)**: Allows you to change the text of a node in TreeView.

* **[Sorting](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/treeview#sortorder)**: Allows display of the TreeView nodes in an `ascending`
or a `descending` order.

* **[Template](../treeview/template)**: Allows you to customize the nodes in TreeView.

* **[Accessibility](../treeview/accessibility)**: Provides built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the TreeView component features through the keyboard, on-screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
