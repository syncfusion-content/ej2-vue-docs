## WAI-ARIA attributes

The TreeView component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the TreeView component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=tree` | All tree nodes are contained within the element. |
| `role=treeitem `| Specifies the role of each tree node in a selectable TreeView and its containment within the tree. |
| `role=group` | Specifies the role of each parent node container. |
| `role=checkbox` | Indicates checkbox control along with treeitem element. |
| `aria-multiselectable` | Indicates whether the TreeView enables multiple selection or not. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates whether the parent node has expanded or not. |
| `aria-selected` | Indicates the selected node. |
| `aria-grabbed` | Indicates the selected state on drag-and-drop of node. |
| `aria-level` | Indicates the level of node in TreeView. |
| `aria-checked` | Indicates the current checked state of TreeView checkbox. |
| `aria-label` | Indicates the contextual message for the TreeView checkbox. |
| `aria-activedescendant` | Identifies the currently active element when focusing on the TreeView. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates element is perceivable but disabled. |

## Keyboard interaction

The TreeView component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the TreeView component.

| Interaction Keys | Description |
|------|---------|
| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> | Goes to the previous node. |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd> | Goes to the next node. |
| <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd> | Expands the current node. |
| <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd> | Collapses the current node. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> | Goes to the first node. |
| <kbd>End</kbd> | Goes to the last node. |
| <kbd>F2</kbd> | Edits the focused node. |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Focuses out the edit state without saving the edited text. |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Selects the focused node/saves the edited text. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | Checks the current node. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + A</kbd> | Selects all nodes. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The TreeView component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the TreeView component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/treeview.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the TreeView component with accessibility tools.
