# Validate image on drop in Vue Uploader component

The uploader component allows you to upload all type of images by setting `image/*` to [allowedExtensions](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/uploader/#allowedextensions) property or directly you can set it to accept attribute of uploader element.

By default, the behavior is working with select a file using browse button. But, this behavior doesnâ€™t support on drag and drop the files. You can handle this behavior manually using [selected](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/uploader/#selected) event by filtering the file types from application.

In the following example, validated image files using images/*. You are able to drag and drop the image files with extension of png, jpg, bpg, gif and tiff to upload it.

{% include code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs11/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
