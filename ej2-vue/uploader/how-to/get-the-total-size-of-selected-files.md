# Get the total size of selected files in Vue Uploader component

You can get the total size of selected files before upload it to designated server. By using [selected](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/uploader/#selected) event you can achieve this behavior.

In the following example, explains about how to calculate total file size before upload.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs8/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs8/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs8" %}
