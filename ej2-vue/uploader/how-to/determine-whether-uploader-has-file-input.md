# Determine whether uploader has file input in Vue Uploader component

By setting **required** attribute to uploader input element, you can validate the file input has any value in it. In the below sample, set required attribute to the uploader input element and showcase the validation failure message using `data-required-message` attribute.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs7/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs7" %}
