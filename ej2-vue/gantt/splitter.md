# Splitter in Vue Gantt component

## Splitter

In the Gantt component, the Splitter separates the TreeGrid section from the Chart section. You can change the position of the Splitter when loading the Gantt component using the [`splitterSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/splitterSettings/) property. By splitting the TreeGrid from the chart, the width of the TreeGrid and chart sections will vary in the component. The [`splitterSettings.position`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/splitterSettings/#position) property denotes the percentage of the TreeGrid sectionâ€™s width to be rendered and this property supports both pixels and percentage values. You can define the splitter position as column index value using the [`splitterSettings.columnIndex`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/splitterSettings/#columnindex) property. You can also define the splitter position with built-in splitter view modes by using the [`splitterSettings.view`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/splitterSettings/#view) property. The following list is the possible values for this property:

* `Default`: Shows Grid side and Gantt side.
* `Grid`: Shows Grid side alone in Gantt.
* `Chart`: Shows chart side alone in Gantt.

## Change splitter position dynamically

In Gantt, we can change the splitter position dynamically by using [`setSplitterPosition`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#setsplitterposition) method. Either We can change the splitter position with splitter position or columnIndex values by passing these values as arguments to [`setSplitterPosition`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#setsplitterposition) method. The following code example shows how to use this methods.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/appearance-customization-cs9/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/appearance-customization-cs9" %}
