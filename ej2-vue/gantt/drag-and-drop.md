# Drag and Drop in Vue Gantt component

## Drag and drop

You can dynamically rearrange the rows in the Gantt control by using the `allowRowDragAndDrop` property. Using this property, row drag and drop can be enabled or disabled in Gantt. Using this feature, rows can be dropped at above and below as a sibling or child to the existing rows

To use row drag and drop feature, inject the `RowDD` and `Edit` modules in the `provide` section.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs5/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs5/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs5" %}

### Multiple row drag and drop

Gantt also supports dragging multiple rows at a time and drop them on any rows above, below, or at child positions. In Gantt, you can enable the multiple drag and drop by setting the `selectionSettings.type` to `Multiple` and you should enable the `allowRowDragAndDrop` property.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs6/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs6/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs6" %}

### Taskbar drag and drop between rows

The Gantt feature empowers users to efficiently reorganize records by seamlessly moving taskbar and rearranging their positions through a simple drag-and-drop action. Using this feature, rows can be dropped at above and below as a sibling or child to the existing rows.

This mode can be enable by setting the [allowTaskbarDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#allowtaskbardraganddrop) property to `true`.

To use row drag and drop feature, inject the `RowDD` and `Edit` module in Gantt.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs14/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs14/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs14" %}

### Drag and drop events

We provide various events to customize the row drag and drop action, the following table explains about the available events and its details.

Event Name |Description
-----|-----
`rowDragStartHelper`  |Triggers when clicking the drag icon or Gantt row.
`rowDragStart`  |Triggers when drag action starts in Gantt.
`rowDrag`  |Triggers while dragging the Gantt row.
`rowDrop`  |Triggers when a drag row was dropped on the target row.

### Customize row drag and drop action

In Gantt, the `rowDragStartHelper` and `rowDrop` events are triggered on row drag and drop action. Using this event, you can prevent dragging of particular record, validate the drop position, and cancel the drop action based on the target record and dragged record. The following topics explains about this.

#### Prevent dragging of particular record

You can prevent drag action of the particular record by setting the `cancel` property to `true`, which is available in the `rowDragStartHelper` event argument based on our requirement. In the following sample, drag action was restricted for first parent record and its child records.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs7/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs7/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs7" %}

#### Validating drop position

You can prevent drop action based on the drop position and target record, by this, you can prevent dropping particular task on a specific task or specific position. This can be achieved by setting the `cancel` property to `true`, which is available in the `rowDrop` event argument.

In the following sample, we have prevented the drop action based on the position. In this sample, you cannot drop row as child in any of the available rows.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs8/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs8/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs8" %}

### Prevent reordering a row as child to another row

You can prevent the default behavior of dropping rows as children to the target by setting the `cancel` property to `true` in [rowDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#rowdrop) event argument. You can also change the drop position after cancelling using [reorderRows](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#reorderrows) method.

In the below example drop action is cancelled and dropped above to target row.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs9/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs9/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs9" %}

### Perform row drag and drop action programmatically

Gantt provides option to perform row drag and drop action programmatically by using the `reorderRows` method, this method can be used for any external actions like button click.

The following arguments are used to specify the positions to drag and drop a row:

* `fromIndexes`: Index value of source(dragging) row.
* `toIndex`: Value of target index.
* `position`: Drop positions such as above, below, or child.

The following code example shows how to drag and drop a row on button click action.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs10/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs10/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/rows-cs10" %}
