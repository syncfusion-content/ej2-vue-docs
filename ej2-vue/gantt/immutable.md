# Immutable in Vue Gantt component

The immutable mode optimizes the Gantt re-rendering performance by using the object reference and [deep compare](https://dmitripavlutin.com/how-to-compare-objects-in-javascript/#4-deep-equality) concept. When performing the Gantt actions, it will only re-render the modified or newly added rows and prevent the re-rendering of the unchanged rows.

To enable this feature, you have to set the [enableImmutableMode](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt#enableimmutablemode) property as **true**.

> This feature uses the primary key value for data comparison. So, you need to provide the [isPrimaryKey](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/column/#isprimarykey) column.
