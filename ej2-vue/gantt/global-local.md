# Global local in Vue Gantt component

## Localization

The [`Localization`](../common/localization) library allows you to localize default text content of the Gantt.
The Gantt component has static text on some features (like toolbar area text, etc.)
that can be changed to other cultures (Arabic, Deutsch, French, etc.) by defining the
[`locale`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#locale) value and translation object.

The following list of properties and its values are used in the Gantt.

### Loading translations

To load translation object in an application use [`load`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/l10n/#load) function of [`L10n`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/base/l10n/) class.

The below example demonstrates the Gantt in **Deutsch** culture.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/global-cs1" %}

## Internationalization

The [`Internationalization`](../common/internationalization/) library is used to globalize number, date, and time values in gantt component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/global-cs2" %}

> * In the above sample, `Timeline` is formatted by `NumberFormatOptions` and `DateFormatOptions`.
> * By default, [`locale`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#locale) value is `en-US`. If you want to change `en-US` culture, then set the [`locale`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#locale).

## Right to left (RTL)

RTL provides an option to switch the text direction and layout of the Gantt component from right to left. It improves the user experiences and accessibility for users who use right-to-left languages (Arabic, Urdu, etc.). To enable RTL Gantt, set the [`enableRtl`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/#enablertl) to true.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/global-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/global-cs3" %}
