# Indent And Outdent in Vue Gantt Chart Component

Indent and Outdent of a task are used to update the level of the task in hierarchical order of the task. It can be performed by enabling the [editSettings.allowEditing](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/gantt/editSettings#allowediting) property.

`Indent` - Selected task can be indented to the level of the task in the hierarchical order. It can be performed by using in-built context menu or toolbar items. It can also be invoked by using the `indent` method dynamically on any action like external button click. The following code example shows how to enable indent option in the Gantt Chart.

`Outdent` - Selected task can be outdented from the hierarchical order. It can be performed by using in-built context menu or toolbar items. It can also be invoked by using the `outdent` method dynamically on any action like external button click. The following code example shows how to enable outdent option in the Gantt Chart.
