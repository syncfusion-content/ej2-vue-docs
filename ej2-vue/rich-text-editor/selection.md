# Text Selection Using Slider in Vue Component

The Rich Text Editor supports character range-based text selection using the **Syncfusion Slider** component. This feature allows users to select a specific range of characters (e.g., 33â€“45) within the editor content, which is then automatically highlighted.

This functionality is useful for scenarios where precise text selection is needed for operations such as copying, formatting, or analysis.

> **Note:** The example below assumes the Rich Text Editor contains plain text wrapped in a single `<p>` tag for simplicity.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/selection/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/selection/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/rich-text-editor/selection" %}
