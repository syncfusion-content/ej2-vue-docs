# Accessibility in Vue Rich text editor component

The Rich Text Editor component is designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to WAI-ARIA specifications and implementing ARIA roles, states, and properties. This ensures full accessibility support, making it user-friendly for people who rely on assistive technologies (AT) or keyboard navigation.

The accessibility compliance for the Rich Text Editor component is outlined below.

## ARIA Attributes

The toolbar in the Rich Text Editor is assigned the role of 'Toolbar' and includes the following attributes.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| role="toolbar" | This attribute added to the ToolBar element describes the actual role of the element. |
| aria-orientation     | Indicates the ToolBar orientation. Default value is `horizontal`. |
| aria-haspopup       | Indicates the popup mode of the Toolbar. Default value is false. When popup mode is enabled,  attribute value has to be changed to `true`. |
| aria-disabled       | Indicates the disabled state of the toolbar. |
| aria-owns | Identifies an element to define a visual, functional, or contextual parent/child relationship between DOM elements when the DOM hierarchy cannot represent the relationship. In the Rich Text Editor, the attribute contains the ID of the Rich Text Editor to indicate the popup as a child element. |

For more details on Toolbar ARIA attributes, refer to the [`Accessibility of Toolbar`](../../toolbar/accessibility.html) documentation.

* The Rich Text Editor element is assigned the role of `application`.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| role="application" | This attribute added to the Rich Text Editor element describes the actual role of the element. |
| aria-disabled       | Indicates the disabled state of the ToolBar. |

## Keyboard Navigation

The Rich Text Editor component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Rich Text Editor component.

For more details on keyboard navigation, refer to the [Keyboard support](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/rich-text-editor/keyboard-support) documentation.

### Customizing Shortcut Keys

You can customize shortcut keys using the [formatter](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/rich-text-editor/#formatter) property.This allows you to configure custom key combinations for various actions in the Rich Text Editor. For example, you can set `ctrl+q` to open the `Insert Hyperlink` dialog.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/toolbar-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/toolbar-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/rich-text-editor/toolbar-cs3" %}

> We need to import `IHtmlFormatterModel` and `HTMLFormatter` to configure the shortcut key.

## Implementing Accessibility Best Practices

The Rich Text Editor component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Rich Text Editor component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/rich-text-editor.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Rich Text Editor component with accessibility tools.
