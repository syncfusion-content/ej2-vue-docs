# Quotation formatting in Vue Rich Text Editor Component

The Rich Text Editor facilitates quotation formatting through the `Blockquote` tool available in the toolbar. Blockquotes are designed to visually highlight significant text, emphasizing key information or quotations by setting them apart from the main content for added emphasis and clarity.

To format text as a quotation, select the desired text and click on the `Blockquote` icon in the toolbar. The selected text will be formatted as a blockquote, typically indented and styled differently from the surrounding content.

Use the `Blockquote` tool in the editor below to see the feature in action.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/quotation-formatting-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/quotation-formatting-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/rich-text-editor/quotation-formatting-cs1" %}

> In a markdown editor, blockquotes are represented using the `>` symbol.
