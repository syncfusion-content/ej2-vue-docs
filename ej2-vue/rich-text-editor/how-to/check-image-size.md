# Check image size in Vue Rich text editor component

By using the Rich text editor's `imageUploading` event, you can get the image size before uploading and restrict the image to upload, when the given image size is greater than the allowed size.

In the following, we have validated the image size before uploading and determined whether the image has been uploaded or not.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/getting-started-cs14/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor/getting-started-cs14/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/rich-text-editor/getting-started-cs14" %}
