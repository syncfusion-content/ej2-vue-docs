# Integrate badge into listview in Vue Badge component

The badges can be integrated with the `listview` component to indicate new notification with colour based on priority.

In the following sample, `default` badges are used and there is no need to customize the badge size. The component will automatically adjust the size based on the container element.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1" %}
