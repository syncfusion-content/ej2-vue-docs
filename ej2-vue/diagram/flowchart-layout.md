# Flowchart layout in Vue Diagram control

The flowchart layout provides a visual representation of processes, workflows, systems, or algorithms in a diagrammatic format. It uses various symbols to depict different actions, with arrows connecting these symbols to indicate the flow or direction of the process. Flowcharts are essential tools for illustrating step-by-step sequences, making complex processes easier to understand and communicate.

## Common flowchart symbols

Different flowchart symbols have different meanings that are used to represent different states in flowchart. The following table describes the most common flowchart symbols that are used in creating flowchart.

## Render Flowchart layout with data source

To render `flowchart` layout, you need to set the [`layoutType`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/layout/#type) property as `Flowchart`. The following code example displays how to render flowchart layout using data source.


{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs1" %}

>Note: If you want to convert the data source into flowchart layout, you need to inject DataBinding along with FlowchartLayout module in the diagram.


## Defining data source with appearance configuration

In the flowchart layout, you can define the desired shape, style, and label for each node, as well as the decorator type for connectors, directly within the data source. The data source should be structured as shown in the example below:

```javascript
 let Data =  [
        {
            "id": "A",
            "name": "Start",
            "shape": "Terminator",
            "color": "#90EE90",
            "parentId": null,
            "stroke": "#333",
            "strokeWidth": 2
        },
        {
            "id": "B",
            "name": "Process",
            "shape": "Process",
            "color": "#4682B4",
            "parentId": [
                "A"
            ],
            "label":['A-B'],
            "arrowType": "Fletch",
            "stroke": "#333",
            "strokeWidth": 2
        },
    ]

```


### Field Definitions
- `name`: Represents the annotation displayed on the node.
- `shape`: Defines the shape of the node (e.g., Terminator, Process).
- `color`: Specifies the fill color of the node.
- `stroke`: Defines the border color of the node.
- `strokeWidth`: Specifies the border thickness of the node.
- `label`: Adds annotations to the incomming connectors.
- `arrowType`: Determines the arrowhead type (decorator) of the incoming connector (e.g., Diamond, Fletch).

This structure allows for easy customization of the flowchart's visual elements based on the provided data source.


## Render Flowchart layout with nodes and connectors

The following example demonstrates how to render a flowchart layout using nodes and connectors. To achieve this, you need to define the [`nodes`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/nodeModel/) and [`connectors`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/connectormodel/) collections and assign them to the diagram. Additionally, you need to set the [`layoutType`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/layoutType/) to `Flowchart`.


{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs2/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs2" %}

## Customize flowchart layout orientation

The sequence of a node's direction can be customized by flowchart's orientation, either vertically from top to bottom or horizontally from left to right. The [orientation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/layoutOrientation/) property of the layout class allows you to define the flow direction for the flowchart as either `TopToBottom` or `LeftToRight`. The default orientation is `TopToBottom`.


### TopToBottom orientation

This orientation arranges elements in the layout vertically, flowing from top to bottom. It is commonly used in flowcharts to represent the sequential progression of steps or actions in a process.

```javascript
  export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
      "ejs-diagram": DiagramComponent
    },
    data() {
      return {
        width: '100%',
        height: '645px',
        layout: {
                //Sets layout type
                type: 'Flowchart',
                //Sets the orientation of the layout
                orientation: 'TopToBottom'
            },
      };
    }
};

```

![EJ2 Flowchart layout diagram](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_Layout.png)


### LeftToRight orientation

This orientation arranges elements in the layout horizontally, flowing from left to right. It is typically used to represent processes or workflows that move sequentially across the page, emphasizing a linear progression of steps or actions.

```javascript

  export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
      "ejs-diagram": DiagramComponent
    },
    data() {
      return {
        width: '100%',
        height: '645px',
        layout: {
                //Sets layout type
                type: 'Flowchart',
                //Sets the orientation of the layout
                orientation: 'LeftToRight'
            },
      };
    }
};

```

## Customize the decision output directions

The decision symbol in a flowchart represents a question or condition that leads to different paths based on a binary outcome (Yes/No, True/False). You can customize the output direction of these paths using the [`yesBranchDirection`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/branchDirection/) and [`noBranchDirection`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/branchDirection/) properties of the [`flowchartLayoutSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/flowchartLayoutSettingsModel/) class.

- `LeftInFlow` - Arranges the Yes/No branch to the left of the decision symbol.
- `RightInFlow` - Arranges the Yes/No branch to the right of the decision symbol.
- `SameAsFlow` - Aligns the Yes/No branch in the same direction as the flow of the decision symbol.

The following example shows flowchart layout with `yesBranchDirection` as `SameAsFlow` and `noBranchDirection` as `LeftInFlow`.


{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs3/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs3/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/diagram/automatic-layout/flowchart-cs3" %}

The following table will explain the pictorial representation of the behavior:

|YesBranchDirection| NoBranchDirection | TopToBottom | LeftToRight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Left In Flow |Right In Flow|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_VerticalLeftAndRightBranches.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_HorizontalLeftAndRightBranches.png)|
| Right In Flow |Left In Flow |![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_VerticalRightAndLeftBranches.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_HorizontalRightAndLeftBranches.png) |
| Same As Flow |Right In Flow |![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_VerticalSameAndRightBranches.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_HorizontalSameAndRightBranches.png) |
| Same As Flow |Left In Flow |![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_YesSame_NoLeft.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_YesSame_NoLeft_LTR.png) |
| Right In Flow | Same As Flow |![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_VerticalRightAndSameBranches.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_HorizontalRightAndSameBranches.png) |
| Left In Flow | Same As Flow |![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_YesLeft_NoSame.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_YesLeft_NoSame_LTR.png) |
|Same As Flow |Same As Flow|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Vertical](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_VerticalSameBranches.png)|![EJ2 Diagram displays Decision Output in Horizontal](./images/flowchart-images/Flowchart_HorizontalSameBranches.png)|

>Note: If both branch directions are same, **Yes** branch will be prioritized.


## Custom Yes and No branch values

The decision symbol produces two output branches: a Yes branch and a No branch. If the connector text value matches any value in the [`yesBranchValues`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/flowchartLayoutSettingsModel/#yesbranchvalues) property of the [`flowchartLayoutSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/flowchartLayoutSettingsModel/) class, it will be considered a Yes branch. Similarly, if the connector text value matches any value in the [`noBranchValues`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/diagram/flowchartLayoutSettingsModel/#nobranchvalues) property, it will be considered a No branch. By default, the `yesBranchValues` property contains the string values **Yes** and **True**, while the `noBranchValues` property contains **No** and **False**.

Any text can be used as the connector text to describe the flow. Additionally, custom string values can be assigned to the `yesBranchValues` and `noBranchValues` properties. To direct the flow based on a conditional decision (if/else), the connector text must match a value in either the `yesBranchValues` or `noBranchValues` properties.

The following example shows how to set custom text to the yes branch and no branch values.
