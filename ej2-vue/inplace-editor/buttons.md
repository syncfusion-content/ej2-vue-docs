# Buttons in Vue Inplace editor component

The In-place Editor had an action for save and cancel using buttons. The [saveButton](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#savebutton) and [cancelButton](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#cancelbutton) properties accept the [ButtonModel](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/button/buttonModel/) objects for customizing the save and cancel button properties.

Buttons can be show or hide by sets a Boolean value to the [showButtons](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#showbuttons) property.

> Without buttons value will be processed via the following ways.

* **[actionOnBlur](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#actiononblur)**: By clicking out side the editor component get focus out and do action based on this property value.
* **[submitOnEnter](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#submitonenter)**: Pressing `Enter` key it performs the submit action, if this property set to `true`.

In the following sample, the [content](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/button/#content) and [cssClass](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/button/#cssclass) properties of `Button` value assigned to the [saveButton](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#savebutton) and [cancelButton](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/inplace-editor/#cancelbutton) properties to customize its appearance. Also check or uncheck a checkbox buttons render or removed from the editor.

To restrict either save or cancel button rendering into a DOM, simply pass empty object `{}` in the `saveButton` or `cancelButton` properties.
