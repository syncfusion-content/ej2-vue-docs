# Reset an image in the Vue Image Editor component

The [`reset`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/javascript/documentation/api/image-editor/#reset) method in the Image Editor control provides the capability to undo all the changes made to an image and revert it back to its original state. This method is particularly useful when multiple adjustments, annotations, or transformations have been applied to an image and you want to start over with the original, unmodified version of the image. 

By invoking the `reset` method, any modifications or edits made to the image will be undone, and the image will be restored to its initial state. This allows you to easily discard any changes and begin again with the fresh, unaltered image.
