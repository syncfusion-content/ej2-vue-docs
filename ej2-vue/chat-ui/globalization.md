# Globalization in Vue Chat UI component

## Localization
 
The Chat UI can be localized to any culture by defining the text of the Chat UI in the corresponding culture. The default locale of the Chat UI is `en` (English). The following table represents the default text of the Chat UI in `en` culture.
 
|KEY|Text|
|----|----|
|oneUserTyping|{0} is typing|
|twoUserTyping|{0} and {1} are typing|
|threeUserTyping|{0}, {1}, and {2} other are typing|
|multipleUsersTyping|{0}, {1}, and {2} others are typing|
 
## RTL
 
RTL provides an option to switch the text direction and layout of the Chat UI component from right to left by setting the `enableRtl` property to `true`.
