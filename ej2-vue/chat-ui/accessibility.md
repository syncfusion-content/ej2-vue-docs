## Ensuring Accessibility

The Chat UI component's accessibility levels are ensured by running it through automated testing using the [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools. This process helps us identify and address potential accessibility issues, ensuring that the component provides an inclusive experience for all users.
