# Formulas in Vue Spreadsheet component

Formulas are used for calculating the data in a worksheet. You can refer the cell reference from same sheet or from different sheets.

## Usage

You can set formula for a cell in the following ways,

* Using the `formula` property from `cell`, you can set the formula or expression to each cell at initial load.
* Set the formula or expression through data binding.
* You can set formula for a cell by [`editing`](./editing).
* Using the [`updateCell`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#updatecell) method, you can set or update the cell formula.

## Create User Defined Functions / Custom Functions

The Spreadsheet includes a number of built-in formulas. For your convenience, a list of supported formulas can be found [here](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/spreadsheet/formulas#supported-formulas).

You can define and use an unsupported formula, i.e. a user defined/custom formula, in the spreadsheet by using the [addCustomFunction](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#addcustomfunction) function. Meanwhile, remember that you should define a user defined/custom formula whose results should only return a single value. If a user-defined/custom formula returns an array, it will be time-consuming to update adjacent cell values.

The following code example shows an unsupported formula in the spreadsheet.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs1" %}

Second, if you want to directly compute any formula or expression, you can use the [computeExpression](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#computeexpression) method. This method will work for both built-in and used-defined/custom formula.

The following code example shows how to use `computeExpression` method in the spreadsheet.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs2/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/formula-cs2" %}

## Formula bar

Formula bar is used to edit or enter cell data in much easier way. By default, the formula bar is enabled in the spreadsheet. Use the [`showFormulaBar`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#showformulabar) property to enable or disable the formula bar.

## Named Ranges

You can define a meaningful name for a cell range and use it in the formula for calculation. It makes your formula much easier to understand and maintain. You can add named ranges to the Spreadsheet in the following ways,

* Using the [`definedNames`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#definednames) collection, you can add multiple named ranges at initial load.
* Use the [`addDefinedName`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#adddefinedname) method to add a named range dynamically.
* You can remove an added named range dynamically using the [`removeDefinedName`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#removedefinedname) method.
* Select the range of cells, and then enter the name for the selected range in the name box.

The following code example shows the usage of named ranges support.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/defined-name-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/defined-name-cs1" %}

## Supported Formulas

The list of supported formulas can be find in following [`link`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/spreadsheet/formulas#supported-formulas).

## Formula Error Dialog

If you enter an invalid formula in a cell, an error dialog with an error message will appear. For instance, a formula with the incorrect number of arguments, a formula without parenthesis, etc.

| Error Message | Reason |
|-------|---------|
| We found that you typed a formula with an invalid arguments | Occurs when passing an argument even though it wasn't needed. |
| We found that you typed a formula with an empty expression | Occurs when passing an empty expression in the argument. |
| We found that you typed a formula with one or more missing opening or closing parenthesis | Occurs when an open parenthesis or a close parenthesis is missing. |
| We found that you typed a formula which is improper | Occurs when passing a single reference but a range was needed. |
| We found that you typed a formula with a wrong number of arguments | Occurs when the required arguments were not passed. |
| We found that you typed a formula which requires 3 arguments | Occurs when the required 3 arguments were not passed. |
| We found that you typed a formula with a mismatched quotes | Occurs when passing an argument with mismatched quotes. |
| We found that you typed a formula with a circular reference | Occurs when passing a formula with circular cell reference. |
| We found that you typed a formula which is invalid | Except in the cases mentioned above, all other errors will fall into this broad category. |
