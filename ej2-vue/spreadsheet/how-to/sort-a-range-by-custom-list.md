# Sort a range by custom list in Vue Spreadsheet component

You can also define the sorting of cell values based on your own customized personal list. In this article, custom list is achieved using `custom sort comparer`.

In the following demo, the `Trustworthiness` column is sorted based on the custom lists `Perfect`, `Sufficient`, and `Insufficient`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/custom-sort-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/custom-sort-cs1" %}
