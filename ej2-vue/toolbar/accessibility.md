# Accessibility in Vue Toolbar component

WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-label`, and `aria-orientation`, It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology.  The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/), and has been tested in major screen readers.
