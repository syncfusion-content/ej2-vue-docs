# Index in Vue Treegrid component

The Essential Studio for JavaScript TreeGrid is a feature-rich control used to visualize  self-referential hierarchical data effectively in a tabular format. It can pull data from data sources such as an array of JSON, RESTful services, `OData services`, `WCF services` or `DataManager` and binding data fields to columns. It also expands or collapses child data using the tree column.
