# Syncfusion Vue supported versions

## Vue version compatibility

The following table represents the supported Vue versions by different Syncfusion Vue UI components releases.

| Version | Syncfusion Vue components version |

## Syncfusion version information

Syncfusion follows a quarterly release schedule, introducing new volumes every three months. To track these releases and their associated changes, Syncfusion Vue components utilize a sequence-based identifier system, employing the format **Major.Minor.Revision**. This system enables developers to easily monitor modifications made in each release.

For example, if the release package version is `22.1.34`, the version number can be interpreted as follows:

* **22** represents the `major release` version. This number changes every three months and encompasses significant updates, new features, as well as bug fixes and breaking changes.

* **1** corresponds to the `minor release` version. This number signifies releases primarily focused on new features and addressing bugs, without introducing breaking changes.

* **34** denotes the `revision number`, also referred to as the `patch number`. This number increases for weekly patch releases, which predominantly consist of bug fixes and do not introduce new features or breaking changes.
