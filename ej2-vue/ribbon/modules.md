# Modules in Ribbon component

The following modules are available in Ribbon. If the module injection type is **selective**, manual injection is required to extend the Ribbon's functionality.

| `RibbonButton` | To use the built-in button as a ribbon item. | default |
| `RibbonCheckBox` | To use the built-in checkbox as a ribbon item.| default |
