# Center the dialog based on current scroll position in Vue Dialog component

The dialog is always centered based on the target container. If the target is not specified, then the dialog will be rendered based on its body and centered in the position of the current viewpoint.

In the following sample, the model dialog is centered based on its current scroll position of the page.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="app.vue" %}
{% include code-snippet/dialog/center-the-dialog-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/dialog/center-the-dialog-cs1" %}
